# Genesis
Procedural generation of 3D Perlin noise maps in Roblox, originally created for a game and turned into an open-source library.
Supports creation of terrain and placement of objects using a unique algorithm to handle the challenges of the build in terrain system.

# Demo
An example place using the library can be played and edited directly on [Roblox](https://www.roblox.com/games/15529154687/Genesis-Demo).
Source code available in the `demo` folder which can be built using [Rojo](https://rojo.space), by using `demo.project.json`.

# Install
Genesis is available as a package on [Wally](https://wally.run/package/triankl3/genesis?version=1.0.0).

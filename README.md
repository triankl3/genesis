# Genesis
Originally developed for a game and turned into an open-source library.
Handles procedural generation of 3D Perlin noise maps in Roblox. Supports generation of terrain and placement of objects using a unique algorithm to handle the challenges of the built in terrain system.

# Demo
An example place using the library can be played and edited directly on [Roblox](https://roblox.com).
You can also find the source code under the /demo folder which can be built using [Rojo](https://rojo.space).
VS Code tasks are included to make this process easier.

Genesis is available as a package on [Wally](https://wally.run).
You can also install Genesis by downloading the following [Roblox Model](https://roblox.com).
